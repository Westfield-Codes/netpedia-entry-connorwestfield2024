  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>The Wayback Machine was developed in 1996, however only released to the public in 2001, by Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. The Wayback Machine was created as a way for people to visit past iterations of websites to see how they may have looked long ago, theoretically preserving what would otherwise be lost media.</p>
  <h2>Founders & Purpose</h2>
  <p>The founders of the Wayback Machine, Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat, came up with the idea of the Wayback Machine to solve the problem of losing content and information of a web page whenever it is changed or shut down. By preserving an archived copy of a given webpage, even if the original page is lost or changed, the Wayback Machine allows for people to still visit what would otherwise be inaccessible or otherwise lost media across the entire web.</p>
  <h2>Effects on the web</h2>
  <p>The Wayback Machine has been preserving billions upon billions of pages since it's launch in 1996. At the end of 2009 alone, more than 38.2 <strong>billion</strong> webpages have already been archived by the Wayback Machine. This number would increase almost 22 times that in 2024, where the total number of archived pages saved in the Wayback Machine skyrocketed all the way to <strong>860 billion</strong>, which is equivalent to 99 petabytes of space. In conclusion, the Wayback machine has been helping to make sure nothing truly is lost or forgotten on the internet, keeping a log of anything and everything for years to come.</p>
